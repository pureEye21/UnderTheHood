Implement the following in MIPS in teams of 3-5:

1. Take two non-negative numbers, a and b as input. Output their gcd.

2. Take a positive integer n(>1) as input and output the n<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number (F<sub>0</sub> = 0, F<sub>1</sub> = 1). Your code should be iterative (i.e., use `j`)

3. Same as Q2. except your code should be recursive (i.e., use `jal`)
For this question, it would be useful for you to know about stack management, so read up about `$sp` and how it is used to make use of the stack.

You're expected to decorate your I/O. Dont just give us a bland interface which results in
```
12
20
4
```

It should at least look like-
```
a = 12
b = 20
Resulting gcd = 4
```
