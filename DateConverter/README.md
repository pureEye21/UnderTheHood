## DATE CONVERTER
Team name - [rishi_abir_dhruv_vishant]

The final phase of the project required us to implement a Date Converter using MIPS Assembly Language.
It has the following two functions
1. To convert the date into a required format(eg - DD/MM/YYYY)
2. To check what was the weekday on that date

The program takes 3 inputs initially - Date, Month and Year. Then you have to choose the required format and 
then it asks you if you want to know the weekday or not. There is also a restart option at the end so that 
you can add another date.
